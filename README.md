# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

Algortimul Radix Sort sorteaza vectorul prin selectia maximului.
Alrgoritmul e implementat in C

The Radix Sort algorithm sorts the array by the maximum element selection.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
